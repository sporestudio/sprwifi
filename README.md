# SPRWIFI CRACKER
Tool to automate WiFi attacks (WPA/WPA2 - PSK) aimed at obtaining a password.

</br>

>[!WARNING]
>This tool is under development and testing, it is not yet functional.

The wifiCrack tool has 2 attack modes. The first one is the Handshake attack, where in an automated way, it manages everything necessary for a classic de-authentication and reconnection attack by a station to obtain a valid Handshake with which it can later work to apply brute force.

The second attack mode is the PKMID ClientLess Attack, which focuses its attention on wireless networks that do not have associated clients (Modern Method).
